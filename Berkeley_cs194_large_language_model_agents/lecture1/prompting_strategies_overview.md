# Prompting Strategies Overview

This document provides descriptions, examples, prompt instructions, and detailed examples for various prompting strategies used in large language models (LLMs).

## 1. Few-Shot Prompting

**Description**:  
Few-shot prompting provides the model with a few examples of how a task should be performed before asking it to perform the task itself. This allows the model to learn from the patterns in the provided examples and apply that knowledge to similar tasks.

**Example**:  
```
The last letter of "Elon" is N. The last letter of "Musk" is K, concatenated NK. It's called NK.
The last letter of "Bill" is L. The last letter of "Gates" is S, concatenated LS. It's called LS.
The last letter of "Barack" is K. The last letter of "Obama" is A, concatenated KA. It's called?
```

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Provide a few examples of how the task should be solved and then present a similar test case for the model to answer. Ensure the examples follow a clear pattern that the model can use to generalize."

**Detailed Example Using the Prompt Instruction**:  
**Prompt**:  
```
The last letter of "Taylor" is R. The last letter of "Swift" is T, concatenated RT. It's called RT.
The last letter of "Lionel" is L. The last letter of "Messi" is I, concatenated LI. It's called LI.
The last letter of "Michael" is L. The last letter of "Jordan" is N, concatenated LN. It's called?
```

**Model's Expected Response**:  
```
LN
```

## 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

**Description**:  
Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to break down a complex problem into smaller, logical reasoning steps to arrive at a final answer.

**Example**:  
```
Problem: Elsa has 3 apples. Anna has 2 more apples than Elsa. How many apples do they have together?

Reasoning:
- Anna has 2 + 3 = 5 apples.
- Together, they have 3 + 5 = 8 apples.

Answer: 8
```

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Ask the model to reason through the problem step by step, encouraging the explanation of intermediate steps before providing the final answer."

**Detailed Example Using the Prompt Instruction**:  
**Prompt**:  
```
John has 7 oranges. Mary has 3 more oranges than John. How many oranges do they have together? Think step by step and explain your reasoning.
```

**Model's Expected Response**:  
```
John has 7 oranges.
Mary has 7 + 3 = 10 oranges.
Together, they have 7 + 10 = 17 oranges.
```

## 3. Zero-Shot Prompting

**Description**:  
Zero-shot prompting asks the model to perform a task without any examples or prior guidance.

**Example**:  
```
Question: What is the capital of France?
Let's think step by step.
```

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Ask the model to think through the task or question step by step, without providing any example. Encourage logical deductions even if no examples are given."

**Detailed Example Using the Prompt Instruction**:  
**Prompt**:  
```
What is the square root of 16? Let's think step by step before answering.
```

**Model's Expected Response**:  
```
The square root of 16 is the number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 16. 4 * 4 = 16, so the square root of 16 is 4.
```

## 4. Analogical Reasoning

**Description**:  
Analogical reasoning provides a related problem and its solution to help the model transfer its understanding to the new, target problem.

**Example**:  
```
Problem: A farmer has 6 sheep, 2 cows, and 4 pigs. How many animals does the farmer have in total?

Related Problem: A baker has 5 loaves of bread, 3 croissants, and 2 muffins. How many pastries does the baker have in total?
Solution: The baker has 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 pastries.

Solution to the original problem: The farmer has 6 + 2 + 4 = 12 animals.
```

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Provide the model with a related example problem and its solution, and then present the target problem. Ask the model to solve the target problem by applying the same reasoning."

**Detailed Example Using the Prompt Instruction**:  
**Prompt**:  
```
Problem: A teacher has 4 red pens, 3 blue pens, and 5 black pens. How many pens does the teacher have in total?

Related Problem: A shopkeeper has 6 apples, 4 bananas, and 3 oranges. How many fruits does the shopkeeper have in total?
Solution: The shopkeeper has 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 fruits.

Solution to the original problem: 
```

**Model's Expected Response**:  
```
The teacher has 4 + 3 + 5 = 12 pens.
```

## 5. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Without Prompting

**Description**:  
This technique encourages the model to generate reasoning steps organically, without explicitly being prompted to think step by step.

**Example**:  
```
Question: Was Nicolas Cage born in an even or odd year?
Longer response: Nicolas Cage was born in 1964, which is divisible by 2. Thus, he was born in an even year.
```

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Present a task or question without explicitly asking for step-by-step reasoning, but encourage a detailed response that includes reasoning as part of the answer."

**Detailed Example Using the Prompt Instruction**:  
**Prompt**:  
```
Was the year 1996 an Olympic year?
```

**Model's Expected Response**:  
```
The Summer Olympics happen every 4 years. 1996 is divisible by 4, and the Olympics were indeed held in Atlanta that year. So, yes, 1996 was an Olympic year.
```

## 6. Self-Consistency

**Description**:  
Self-consistency involves sampling multiple responses from the model and choosing the most frequent answer.

**Example**:  
```
(Ask the model the same question multiple times and collect the responses)
Question: How many continents are there in the world?
Responses: 7, 7, 7, 8, 7
Final Answer: 7 (most frequent answer)
```

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Generate multiple responses for the same prompt and select the most common answer among them."

**Detailed Example Using the Prompt Instruction**:  
**Prompt**:  
```
What is the capital of Australia? Generate multiple responses and determine the most common answer.
```

**Model's Expected Response**:  
```
Responses: Canberra, Canberra, Sydney, Canberra, Canberra
Final Answer: Canberra (most frequent response)
```

## 7. Universal Self-Consistency

**Description**:  
Similar to self-consistency, but it applies to free-form or more diverse answers.

**Example**:  
```
(Ask a free-form question and collect diverse responses)
Question: Why do leaves turn yellow in autumn?
Responses: 
- Due to reduced chlorophyll production.
- Because of shorter daylight and cooler temperatures.
- As a result of the breakdown of chlorophyll and other pigments showing through.

Final Answer: Reduced chlorophyll production (most frequent concept in the answers).
```

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Generate multiple diverse responses and look for common reasoning patterns or recurring ideas to determine the most likely explanation."

**Detailed Example Using the Prompt Instruction**:  
**Prompt**:  
```
Why do volcanoes erupt? Generate multiple responses and identify the most common cause across answers.
```

**Model's Expected Response**:  
```
Responses:
- Due to the build-up of pressure from molten rock beneath the Earth's surface.
- Pressure from tectonic plates causes molten rock to rise.
- Magma chambers build up pressure over time, leading to an eruption.

Final Answer: Build-up of pressure from molten rock beneath the Earth's surface.
```
