# Additional Prompting Strategies Overview

This document provides descriptions, examples, prompt instructions, and detailed examples for additional prompting strategies not covered earlier.

---

## 1. Instruction Prompting

**Description**:  
This strategy involves directly instructing the model on what to do. It provides the model with a clear and specific task or instruction in the prompt, ensuring the task is framed in a way that the model can follow.

**Example**:  
"Summarize the following text in one sentence."

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Provide explicit instructions for the task that you want the model to accomplish."

---

## 2. Multi-Task Prompting

**Description**:  
Multi-task prompting provides a single prompt with multiple tasks or objectives for the model to address in the same response.

**Example**:  
"Translate the following sentence to French, then explain the meaning of each word in English."

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Give the model multiple tasks to complete in one go. Be clear about each task's expectations."

---

## 3. Reflection Prompting

**Description**:  
This strategy asks the model to reflect on or critique its own output before finalizing a response. It encourages the model to verify or validate its responses.

**Example**:  
"Answer the question, and then explain why you think your answer is correct."

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"After generating the initial response, prompt the model to review its output and provide a rationale or reflection on its response."

---

## 4. Rephrasing Prompting

**Description**:  
Rephrasing prompting involves asking the model to rephrase or reword its initial output. This can help clarify understanding, offer a different perspective, or ensure that the model is giving the correct response in a different context.

**Example**:  
"Rephrase the following sentence in simpler language."

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Ask the model to express the same idea in a different way, using alternative words or simpler phrasing."

---

## 5. Completion-Based Prompting

**Description**:  
Completion prompting provides a partially completed task or sentence and asks the model to complete it.

**Example**:  
"The sun rises in the east, and it sets in the ______."

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Provide the beginning of a sentence, equation, or task, and ask the model to complete it logically."

---

## 6. Interactive Prompting

**Description**:  
Interactive prompting involves providing ongoing feedback or interaction as part of the prompt, similar to how humans collaborate to solve a problem.

**Example**:  
"Hereâ€™s my first draft of a paragraph. Please help me improve it step by step."

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Engage the model in an iterative conversation or task where it revises or modifies its output based on your feedback."

---

## 7. Contextual Prompting

**Description**:  
This strategy gives the model additional context or background information before asking it to solve a problem or answer a question.

**Example**:  
"Given the following background on machine learning algorithms, answer the question: What is overfitting?"

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Provide the model with the necessary context or background information before asking a task-related question."

---

## 8. Disambiguation Prompting

**Description**:  
This technique asks the model to clarify ambiguities in a given text.

**Example**:  
"The word 'bank' can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river. Which meaning is used in the sentence: 'He stood on the bank and watched the river flow'?"

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Present the model with an ambiguous term or concept and ask it to resolve or explain the ambiguity."

---

## 9. Counterfactual Prompting

**Description**:  
This strategy asks the model to hypothesize or generate counterfactual scenarios that differ from reality.

**Example**:  
"What would have happened if Albert Einstein had never developed the theory of relativity?"

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Ask the model to consider alternate outcomes or hypothetical situations that deviate from known facts."

---

## 10. Self-Critique Prompting

**Description**:  
In self-critique prompting, the model is instructed to review its own response for errors or logic gaps.

**Example**:  
"Explain why the answer you provided might be incorrect or incomplete, and suggest an alternative."

**Prompt Instruction**:  
"Ask the model to critique its own response and suggest improvements, leading to a refined answer."
