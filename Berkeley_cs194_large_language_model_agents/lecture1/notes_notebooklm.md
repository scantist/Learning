## Summary of Prompting Strategies and Examples

This note provides a summary of the prompting strategies introduced in the YouTube source, along with detailed prompt examples for each. 

### Prompting Strategies

*   **Few-Shot Prompting:** This approach involves presenting the LLM with a few examples of the task and then presenting the test example, similar to how machine learning models are trained.

    **Example:**

    ```
    The last letter of "Elon" is N. The last letter of "Musk" is K, concatenated NK. It's called NK.
    The last letter of "Bill" is L. The last letter of "Gates" is S, concatenated LS. It's called LS.
    The last letter of "Barack" is K. The last letter of "Obama" is A, concatenated KA. It's called? 
    ```
*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** This strategy expands on few-shot prompting by including intermediate reasoning steps in the examples provided to the LLM. This helps the model understand the thought process required to arrive at the correct answer. 

    **Example:**

    ```
    Problem: Elsa has 3 apples. Anna has 2 more apples than Elsa. How many apples do they have together?

    Reasoning: 
    - Anna has 2 + 3 = 5 apples.
    - Together they have 3 + 5 = 8 apples.

    Answer: 8
    ```

*   **Zero-Shot Prompting:** This method aims to trigger step-by-step reasoning without providing any explicit examples. The most common approach is to include the phrase "Let's think step by step" in the prompt.

    **Example:**

    ```
    Question: What is the capital of France? 
    Let's think step by step.
    ```

*   **Analogical Reasoning:** This strategy presents a related problem and its solution to the model before introducing the target problem. This encourages the model to apply learned patterns and knowledge to new situations.

    **Example:** 

    ```
    Problem: A farmer has 6 sheep, 2 cows, and 4 pigs. How many animals does the farmer have in total? 

    Related Problem: A baker has 5 loaves of bread, 3 croissants, and 2 muffins. How many pastries does the baker have in total?
    Solution: The baker has 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 pastries. 

    Solution to the original problem: The farmer has 6 + 2 + 4 = 12 animals.
    ```

*   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning without Prompting:** This technique suggests that it is possible to activate step-by-step reasoning without using explicit prompts. The idea is to encourage the model to generate longer responses and analyze the probability of predicted tokens to identify potential reasoning paths.

    **Example:** (No specific prompt is used, but the goal is to guide the model towards generating longer responses that might include reasoning steps)

    ```
    Question: Was Nicolas Cage born in an even or odd year?
    Longer response (potentially with reasoning): Nicolas Cage was born in 1964, which is divisible by 2. Thus, he was born in an even year. 
    ```

### Additional Techniques:

*   **Self-Consistency:** This method involves sampling multiple responses from the LLM and selecting the most frequent answer, based on the principle that consistent results are more likely to be accurate.
*   **Universal Self-Consistency:** Similar to self-consistency, this technique extends the approach to free-form answers, aiming to identify the most common response even if the initial answers are diverse. 


## Extra Highlights
Here are some key takeaways from Professor Zhou's lecture on Large Language Model Agents, besides prompting strategies: 

*   **The Importance of Intermediate Steps:** The lecture heavily emphasizes the significance of intermediate steps in problem-solving with LLMs. Whether through chain-of-thought prompting or other techniques, guiding the model to break down problems into smaller, more manageable steps significantly enhances its reasoning capabilities. 
*   **LLMs as Probabilistic Models:** It's crucial to remember that LLMs are not deterministic but probabilistic models. They generate responses by predicting the next most likely token based on the input and their training data. This probabilistic nature necessitates techniques like self-consistency, which relies on repeated sampling to find the most probable answer. 
*   **Limitations of LLMs:**  Professor Zhou dedicates a significant portion of the lecture to highlighting the limitations of LLMs. They are susceptible to distractions from irrelevant context, struggle with self-correction, and exhibit sensitivity to the order of information presented. Acknowledging these limitations is critical when designing and deploying LLM-based solutions.
*   **Need for Rigorous Evaluation:**  The lecture underscores the importance of designing rigorous evaluation methods for LLM systems. Simply relying on benchmark datasets might not accurately reflect real-world performance. Designing custom tasks that test specific capabilities and vulnerabilities is crucial for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.  
*   **Future Research Directions:** Professor Zhou concludes by highlighting potential avenues for future research. He emphasizes the need to move beyond chasing state-of-the-art results on existing benchmarks and instead focus on addressing fundamental challenges, such as developing more robust reasoning capabilities, improving generalization abilities, and enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM agents.  

The lecture advocates for a grounded and cautious approach to LLM research. While acknowledging the impressive advancements, Professor Zhou encourages a critical perspective that recognizes both the potential and the limitations of these technologies.
